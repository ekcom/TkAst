    <h1>Help | Ticket Assister</h1>

    <h2>Help! X isn't working!</h2>
    <p>Troubleshooting steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Make sure that X is enabled.</p>
            <p>Ensure that you have enabled the feature that you want on the <a href="/pages/options.html">Options page</a>.<br />You will see the checkbox next to the option checked if your current preset (whether predefined or custom) has that feature enabled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Refresh the page.</p>
            <p>After a feature is toggled, it will only become active on the next page load matching the URL which it runs on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Try switching presets and switching back.</p>
            <p>On the <a href="/pages/options.html">Options page</a>, try switching to a different preset (like <code>All Off</code>) and switching back to your current preset.<br />Sometimes setting up the features fails, especially after updates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Make sure that you are up to date.</p>
            <p>Most browsers will do automatic updates of your extensions, but you may need to fully close and reopen your browser for those updates to be applied.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Try clearing your cache and cookies.</p>
            <p>But you knew that already &#9786;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="main-point">Escalate.</p>
			<p>Send me an email or <a href="https://forms.gle/LRpER2t69MrTVqtD8" target="_blank">submit feedback</a>, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A log file from the bottom of the <a href="/pages/options.html">Options page</a></li>
				<li>The current version of TDX that you are accessing (this should be indicated in the title of the Desktop page; it looks something like <code>11.4</code></li>)</li>
				<li>Steps to reproduce the issue</li>
			</ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
